# **Overview**
The objective of my project is to im
plement a software to mimic the functionality of Declare& Declarein queries available in SciTools Understand software analysis toolbox. I have utilized ANTLRv4 and SQLite database to store the outcomes.

# **What changes did I make?**
I added new conditions to the Declare and Declarein file (fix the declare_declarein.py) to be closer to the output of understand using Hierarchy and small test examples like caclculator_app and also test examples like JSON in benchmark with checking them through the JavaParserLabeled.g4 file.

# **output**
these are my output:
