# Core source code metrics development

Reading: 5 minutes, Last update: 10 March 2022

---

The following proposal has been initially prepared for the **IUST Compiler** and **IUST Advanced Compiler**  courses in _Winter/Spring 2022_.

**Note 1:** Before reading this proposal ensure that you have read and understood the [OpenUnderstand white-paper](../index.md).

Students must form groups of up to *four* persons. Each group develops analysis passes to compute the value of source code metrics listed in [Table 3](../source_code_metrics.md).The exact list of the metrics will be assigned to each group subsequently. The description of the source code metrics listed in [Table 3](../source_code_metrics.md) _may_ update during the semester.


**Note 2:** The computation of each source code metric must be implemented as a standalone Python module (single .py file) in the `openuderstand.metrics` package. Consider the existing modules in the packages as examples.


**Note 3:** Each module should be follows [PEP -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and document well.

**Note 4:** Each group is asked to review the code of at least one other group in the classroom. Your final project score is computed considering the score given by referees to each member of the team.


**Note 5:** Before developing your codes ensure that you have pulled the latest version of the OpenUnderstand repository.
For final presentation, your code must pass all unit tests and have no conflicts with other modules. Unit tests are under development, and we will inform you as they are released.


Keep in touch!
