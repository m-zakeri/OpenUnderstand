# Code review and bug fixing 

Reading: 5 minutes, Last update: 25 April 2022

---

The following proposal has been initially prepared for the **IUST Compiler** course.
In addition, the students who want to collaborate on the project later are expected to work on this proposal. 

**Note 1:** Before reading this proposal ensure that you have read and understood the [OpenUnderstand white-paper](../index.md).

For the proposal of this phase, each referee group must review the code and fix the bugs of their assignee group in the previous phases, i.e., [Phase I](core_entity_reference_development.md) and [Phase II](core_source_code_metrics_development.md).

The results of bug fixing are delivered as pull requests on the same modules developed by the assignee groups in the previous phases.
In cases where the assignee group has not developed a required module, the referee group is asked to implement the module.


**Note 2:** Before code review and bug fixing ensure that you have pulled the latest version of the OpenUnderstand repository.
For the final presentation, your code should work properly on the real-world software project existing in the [benchmark](../../benchmark) directory of the OpenUnderstand repository.


**Note 3:** Each python module should follow [PEP -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and document well.
