# Core entity-reference development

The following proposal has been initially prepared for the **IUST Compiler** and **IUST Advanced Compiler**  courses in Fall 2021.

**Note 1:** Before reading this proposal ensure that you have read and understood the [OpenUnderstand white-paper](../index.md).

Students must form groups of up to *three* persons. Each group must develop analysis passed for finding a subset of references kinds listed in [Table 2](../reference_kinds.md) along with their corresponding entities. The exact list of reference kind will be assigned to each group subsequently. The entity kinds in [Table 1](../entity_kinds.md) and references kinds in [Table 2](../reference_kinds.md) _may_ update during the semester for bug fixing purposes.


**Note 2:** Each group is asked to review the code of at least one other group in the classroom. Your final project score is computed considering the score given by referees to each member of the team.


**Note 3:** For final presentation, your code must pass all unit tests. Unit tests are under development, and we will inform you as they are released.

Keep in touch!
